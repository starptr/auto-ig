Automatically do common Instagram actions.

## Features
Below is a list of actions that I do or would like to do on Instagram. The items that are checked off are currently automated by the script in the repo.

- [ ] Make posts
- [x] Like all posts in my feed
- [ ] Comment on posts in my feed
- [ ] Manage my DMs
- [ ] Follow new accounts
- [x] Unfollow accounts with uni-directional relation
- [x] Exceptions for famous accounts that I'm interested in

Estimating by the amount of time I spend on Instagram, ~80% of my account is automated with this.
